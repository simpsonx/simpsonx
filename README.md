### Hi there 👋
You can call me simpson😎

I’m a graduated student major in communication engineering🛰

My current course of study is Signals and Systems📲

  rencently I'm trying to enable the processing of one-dimensional data such as spectra as well as their analysis🛸
  
By the way I‘ve got a hobby of minecraft, and always plan to make a mod for it🎮
